# Natwest Tyl Documenation

The official documentation from Tyl is not completely up to date, so some clarifications. 


## Server to Server notifications


Using the payload from Tyl in combination with the Store Name and Shared secret. Concatenate the following values with a pipe `|` character. 

The documentatioon says to calculate the hash using `chargetotal + sharedsecret + currency + txndatetime + storename + approval_code` but actually it does not include the shared secret, and uses a pipe separator `|`  so it's actaully `chargetotal | currency | txndatetime | storename | approval_code`. 


This is obliquely alluded to in tyle support responses ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è below: 

From Tyl Support 
```
Notification hash for server-to-server notification (using a transactionNotificationURL)
The notification_hash, which is sent in a server-to-server response, is calculated as follows --

SHA256 algorithm
Parameter expected: "notification_hash"
Concatenated string format: chargetotal + sharedsecret + currency + txndatetime + storename + approval_code

HMACSHA256 algorithm
Parameter expected: "notification_hash"
Concatenated string format: chargetotal|currency|txndatetime|storename|approval_code
```

## Fail/Success Resposnse validation 

You must request the extendedResponseHash be enabled for your site, to be able to validate the success/fail POST response from Tyl. 

```
Regarding the extended response hash, this is turned off by default, please may you confirm your store ID and we can make the amendment so that this would be enabled for your store?
